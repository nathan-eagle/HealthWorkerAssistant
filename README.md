# HealthWorkerCopilot üè•

A tool for generating, analyzing, and augmenting healthcare worker interactions in Tagalog and English, focused on common medical conditions in the Quezon province of the Philippines.

## Overview

HealthWorkerCopilot uses language models and speech synthesis to create and analyze simulated community health worker interactions. It processes dialogues through multiple stages: generation, speech synthesis, and analysis.

### AI Models Used

- **Dialogue Generation**
  - GPT-4o and o1 for initial dialogue creation
  - Claude Opus for dialogue expansion and enhancement
  - Focus on maintaining medical accuracy and cultural context

- **Audio Processing**
  - OpenAI TTS for natural speech synthesis
  - Whisper for accurate Tagalog transcription
  - Support for multiple voice profiles and natural conversation flow

- **Analysis Pipeline**
  - Claude Opus for translation and in-depth interaction analysis

### Current Features

- **Dialogue Generation**
  - Generates healthcare dialogues in Tagalog with English code-switching
  - Focuses on common conditions: prenatal care, communicable diseases, and non-communicable diseases
  - Includes cultural context specific to Quezon Province

- **Audio Processing**
  - Converts text dialogues to speech using text-to-speech models
  - Supports different voices for health workers and patients
  - Includes natural pauses and conversation flow

- **Basic Analysis**
