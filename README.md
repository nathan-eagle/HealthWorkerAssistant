# BHW Copilot üè•

An AI-powered platform providing real-time protocol support for over 200,000 Barangay Health Workers (BHWs) serving as frontline healthcare providers across rural Philippines.

## The Challenge

The Philippines faces a critical healthcare crisis with just 1 doctor per 25,280 people. As a result, 200,000 Barangay Health Workers - 90% of whom are women - must deliver essential primary care despite receiving only 5 days of formal training. These dedicated frontline workers serve 70% of Filipinos living in rural and underserved communities.[^1]

## Our Solution

BHW Copilot processes health worker-patient conversations in real-time, comparing them against [Department of Health (DOH) protocols](tree/main/docs) to provide relevant guidance while respecting BHW expertise. By combining generative AI with offline-capable speech recognition, it delivers context-specific support in both Tagalog and English, even in areas with limited connectivity.

Studies show this type of AI guidance can:
- Improve protocol adherence by 67%[^2]
- Enhance diagnostic accuracy by 70%[^2] 
- Increase BHW confidence by 75%[^3]
- Reduce preventable complications through earlier detection and referral[^3]
