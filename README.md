- Early warning signs that require immediate attention
- Guidance for determining the appropriate care pathway

### Maternal Health Protocol (`maternal-health.json`)
- Trimester-specific assessments and measurements
- Required prenatal check-up components
- Nutrition and lifestyle guidance
- Danger signs requiring immediate medical attention
- Educational topics for each stage of pregnancy
- Risk factor monitoring and management

### Communicable Disease Protocol (`communicable-disease.json`)
- Symptom assessment and documentation
- Contact tracing requirements
- Isolation and quarantine guidelines
- Disease-specific warning signs
