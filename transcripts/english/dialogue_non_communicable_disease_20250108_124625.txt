[00:00] BHW: Good morning, Aunt Linda! How are we feeling today?

[00:30] Aunt Linda: Ah, son, I'm fine, except for my aching joints. Thanks for visiting.

[01:00] BHW: You're welcome, Aunt Linda. This is part of our service for you. We just need to make sure your health is in good condition.

[01:30] Aunt Linda: Thank you, son. Your visits really help.

[02:00] BHW: Can we talk about what you're feeling? What symptoms are you experiencing?

[02:30] Aunt Linda: Well, I always feel weak, there's a dull pain in my chest, and I often feel dizzy.

[03:00] BHW: How long have you been experiencing these symptoms? Do you have a family history of diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease?

[03:30] Aunt Linda: It's been about a month, son. And yes, my mother has diabetes and my brother has hypertension.

[04:00] BHW: It's really important that we know your family's health history. Based on the symptoms you mentioned, you might have diabetes.

[04:30] BHW: When was your last medical check-up? Do you regularly see a doctor?

[05:00] Aunt Linda: It's been a while, about a year. I don't regularly, son, because my income from coconut farming is low.

[06:00] BHW: I understand. With our lifestyle, it's important to be active. How are your daily activities?

[06:30] Aunt Linda: Not much. Because of my illness, I can't walk or work in the fields as much.

[07:00] BHW: How about your food, how is your diet? Do you regularly eat fruits and vegetables?

[07:30] Aunt Linda: Not really, son. We still eat more rice and fish.

[08:00] BHW: In such situations, it's really important to have a balanced diet.

[08:30] BHW: How about smoking or drinking? Do you have any vices?

[09:00] Aunt Linda: No, son. I quit those vices a long time ago.

[09:00] BHW: That's good, Aunt Linda. For your condition, it's really important to live a healthy lifestyle. We need to reduce sugar, salt, and fat in our diet.

[09:30] BHW: We also need to increase our intake of fruits and vegetables. And of course, we need regular exercise, even just simple walks around.

[10:00] Aunt Linda: Yes, son. I'll try.

[10:30] BHW: With your illness, Aunt Linda, we need to continue seeing the doctor. This is important for your health.

[11:00] BHW: As for the medicines, we need to take them according to the doctor's prescription. We can't just stop or increase the medicine without the doctor's advice.

[11:30] BHW: And of course, we need the support of the family. This will also be a big help for your health.

[12:00] Aunt Linda: Thank you, son. I will follow your advice.

[12:30] BHW: On our next meeting, I want to know how you've adjusted to my advice. We need this to better monitor your condition.

[13:00] BHW: And if you have any questions or feel something else, don't hesitate to call us. We're always ready to help.

[13:30] Aunt Linda: Thank you, son. I'll update you on my condition.

[14:00] BHW: Thank you too, Aunt Linda. Let's continue our conversation about your health.

[14:30] BHW: And let's not forget to continue taking the medicines and visiting the doctor.

[14:55] Aunt Linda: Yes, son. Thank you for your help and care.

[15:00] BHW: You're welcome, Aunt Linda. Take care and I hope everything will be fine. Until our next meeting.
