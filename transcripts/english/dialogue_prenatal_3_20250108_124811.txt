[00:00] BHW: Good morning, Mrs. Mendoza. I hope this home visit isn't too intrusive. How are you feeling today?

[00:15] Mrs. Mendoza: Good morning. I'm feeling okay. I'm just a little tired.

[01:00] BHW: I understand, pregnancy can really take its toll. Remember, it's important to rest when you can. Now, let's start with your symptoms. Can you describe them to me?

[02:00] Mrs. Mendoza: I've been having headaches and sometimes I feel dizzy. I also noticed that I'm often thirsty and my urine is darker than usual.

[02:30] BHW: I see. And how about your diet? Do you eat regularly? 

[02:45] Mrs. Mendoza: Yes, I eat three times a day, but sometimes I just can't help but eat more, especially fruits.

[03:30] BHW: That's good. Fruits are healthy for you and the baby. Now, I'd like to know more about your medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses in the past?

[04:00] Mrs. Mendoza: None that I can remember, but I was told that I had a mild case of dengue when I was a child.

[04:30] BHW: Noted. And how about your family? Are there any hereditary diseases or conditions that we should know about?

[05:00] Mrs. Mendoza: My mother, God rest her soul, had diabetes. And my sister was diagnosed with hypertension just last year.

[06:00] BHW: I see. It's important to discuss these things as they could potentially affect you or your baby. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Are you doing any form of exercise?

[06:30] Mrs. Mendoza: I do morning walks, but not regularly. Sometimes I'm just too tired or too busy with chores.

[07:00] BHW: It's important to stay active during pregnancy, but always remember to not overdo it. And how about your stress levels?

[07:30] Mrs. Mendoza: I get stressed sometimes, especially with the kids and their online classes. And my husband works in Manila, so he's not always here to help.

[08:00] BHW: It's understandable. But remember, high stress levels can affect your health and your baby. Try to find time for relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation.

[09:00] BHW: Now, let's talk about your condition. Your symptoms suggest gestational diabetes, which is common in pregnant women and can be controlled with proper diet and exercise.

[09:30] Mrs. Mendoza: What do I need to do?

[10:00] BHW: It's important to maintain a balanced diet. Avoid food high in sugar and eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Regular exercise, like your morning walks, is also crucial.

[10:45] BHW: Also, keep yourself hydrated. Your darker urine may suggest that you're not drinking enough water. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day.

[11:30] Mrs. Mendoza: Okay, I understand. It's just a bit overwhelming.

[12:00] BHW: I know it can be challenging, but remember you're not alone. We're here to help you. Now, I will schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to monitor your progress.

[12:30] Mrs. Mendoza: Will I be needing any tests?

[13:00] BHW: Yes, we'll need to conduct a glucose tolerance test to confirm if you have gestational diabetes. This will be done at the Barangay Health Center.

[13:30] BHW: I'll also arrange for a nutritionist to give you a more detailed meal plan and guide you on your diet.

[14:00] Mrs. Mendoza: Thank you. This is really helpful.

[14:30] BHW: You're welcome, Mrs. Mendoza. Remember, the health of your baby is our priority. Take care and I'll see you in two weeks.

[14:55] Mrs. Mendoza: Thank you. God bless and take care as well.
