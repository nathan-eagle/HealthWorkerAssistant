[00:00] BHW: Good morning, Uncle Carding. How are you feeling today?

[00:30] Uncle Carding: Good morning too, dear. My body still hurts a bit, but it's okay.

[01:00] BHW: Thank you for allowing me to visit. I know what you're going through is tough, but we're with you in this fight.

[01:30] Uncle Carding: Thank you very much, dear. Your care for us is a big help.

[02:00] BHW: May I know what symptoms you are experiencing? When did it start?

[02:30] Uncle Carding: It's been about a week, dear. I have a fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.

[03:00] BHW: Do you have any experience with lung diseases like TB? Or maybe you've had other diseases?

[03:30] Uncle Carding: Not really, dear. But I've had asthma for a long time.

[04:00] BHW: Do any of your relatives have a disease similar to what you're experiencing?

[04:30] Uncle Carding: None, dear. I'm the only one feeling this way.

[05:00] BHW: May I know what you were doing before you experienced these symptoms?

[05:30] Uncle Carding: Nothing in particular, dear. Just living a normal life.

[06:00] BHW: How is your diet? Is your nutrition adequate?

[06:30] Uncle Carding: It's a bit lacking, dear. It's hard to make a living.

[07:00] BHW: How about your exercise? Do you have any regular routines?

[07:30] Uncle Carding: Not much, dear. I'm always tired from work.

[08:00] BHW: May I also know how often you drink alcohol or smoke?

[08:30] Uncle Carding: Quite often, dear. But I stopped when I got sick.

[09:00] BHW: Thank you for your answers. Your illness may be due to having TB. It's important to catch this early so it doesn't spread to others.

[09:30] Uncle Carding: TB, dear? Is it contagious?

[10:00] BHW: Yes, Uncle Carding. TB is contagious. That's why it's important that we follow the right steps to prevent its spread.

[10:30] BHW: First, we need to take the right medication. This will be provided by the Barangay Health Center. It's important to continue taking it until the disease is gone.

[11:00] BHW: Second, we need to isolate. This is to prevent our family and fellow villagers from getting infected.

[11:30] BHW: And third, we need to have nutritious food and adequate rest. This will help speed up our recovery.

[12:00] BHW: For our follow-up, can you visit the Barangay Health Center for your check-up and to get your medications?

[12:30] Uncle Carding: Yes, dear. I'll go there.

[13:00] BHW: That's good, Uncle Carding. It's also important that you get an X-ray so we can know the condition of your lungs.

[13:30] BHW: And a final reminder, Uncle Carding. If you have any relatives or friends who have symptoms like yours, tell them to also get checked at the Barangay Health Center.

[14:00] Uncle Carding: Yes, dear. Thanks for your advice.

[14:30] BHW: You're welcome, Uncle Carding. What's important is your health and safety.

[14:55] BHW: Alright, Uncle Carding. I'll be back for your follow-up. Take care and get well soon.
