[00:00] BHW: Good day, Carmen. How are you feeling today?

[00:30] Carmen: Good day to you too, Lina. My abdomen still hurts a bit.

[01:00] BHW: I apologize for the inconvenience, Carmen. We need to look into this for your safety and that of your unborn child.

[01:30] Carmen: No problem, Lina. I know this is for my own good.

[02:00] BHW: That's good, Carmen. Can you tell me your symptoms? When did they start?

[02:30] Carmen: It started about three days ago. My abdomen hurts and there are times when I feel dizzy.

[03:00] BHW: Do you feel anything else? Are there any accompanying symptoms like vomiting or weakness?

[03:30] Carmen: There's no vomiting but I seem to get tired more easily.

[04:00] BHW: Have you had any illnesses before or are you taking any medication?

[04:30] Carmen: None, Lina. I was healthy before, this is the first time I've felt like this.

[05:00] BHW: Alright, Carmen. Let's note this down and I will pass the information to our midwife.

[06:00] BHW: Do you or your family have a history of pregnancy complications?

[06:30] Carmen: My mother didn't have any problems with her pregnancies.

[07:00] BHW: What do you usually eat and drink? Do you exercise regularly?

[07:30] Carmen: I eat properly, Lina. I often eat vegetables and fish. I also include fruits. But I can't move around much now.

[08:00] BHW: It's good that you're eating properly. But remember that movement is also important.

[08:30] BHW: How about your sleep? Are you sleeping well?

[09:00] Carmen: It's a bit difficult, Lina. I seem restless.

[09:30] BHW: The symptoms you're experiencing are normal for pregnant women, Carmen. But we need to monitor your condition.

[10:00] BHW: Make sure you're eating nutritious food and drinking enough water. Rest and relaxation are also important.

[10:30] BHW: If your abdomen hurts, try lying on your left side. It can help reduce the pain.

[11:00] BHW: Also, avoid heavy work. And most importantly, you need regular check-ups.

[11:30] BHW: If there are any changes in your body or how you feel, let us know immediately.

[12:00] BHW: Next week, we might be able to take you to our rural health unit for a check-up. Is that okay with you?

[12:30] Carmen: Sure, Lina. Thank you for your concern.

[13:00] BHW: You're welcome, Carmen. You can also call me if you need anything or if you have any questions.

[13:30] BHW: Just make sure to follow my advice and don't worry. Your health and safety are our priority.

[14:00] Carmen: Yes, I will follow your advice. Thank you again.

[14:30] BHW: You can also visit our barangay health center if you need help. We're here for you.

[14:55] BHW: Take care, Carmen. You can count on our help and support. See you next week for your check-up.
