[00:00] BHW: Good morning, Mr. Pedro. How are you?

[00:15] Mr. Pedro: Ah, good morning too, my BHW. I'm not feeling too well.

[00:30] BHW: I apologize for the inconvenience, but it's important that I know your condition to help you.

[00:50] Mr. Pedro: Thank you, child. I know this is for my own good.

[01:20] BHW: You're right, Mr. Pedro. Let's get started.

[02:00] BHW: Can you detail the symptoms you're experiencing?

[02:15] Mr. Pedro: Ah, recurring fever, and my joints also hurt. I often cough too.

[02:45] BHW: How long have you been feeling this?

[03:00] Mr. Pedro: Probably about a week now.

[03:15] BHW: Do you feel anything else? For example, in breathing, eating?

[03:35] Mr. Pedro: It's somewhat hard to breathe, especially when I cough.

[04:00] BHW: I heard from your neighbor that you're also having diarrhea. Is that true?

[04:15] Mr. Pedro: Ah, yes, that started just recently.

[04:30] BHW: Your symptoms may be related to a type of contagious disease, Mr. Pedro.

[05:00] BHW: About your lifestyle, what do you usually eat?

[05:15] Mr. Pedro: Usually, fish, vegetables, rice. Sometimes pork when there's an occasion.

[05:45] BHW: That's good too. Do you eat fruits?

[06:00] Mr. Pedro: Not much, child. Fruits are expensive these days.

[06:15] BHW: How about your family? Is there a history of diseases?

[06:30] Mr. Pedro: None, but my sibling in Manila, apparently has TB.

[06:50] BHW: Ah, is that so? TB or Tuberculosis is also a type of contagious disease.

[07:15] BHW: Do you have children, Mr. Pedro? How is their health?

[07:30] Mr. Pedro: I have three, but all of them are healthy.

[08:00] BHW: It's good to hear that, Mr. Pedro.

[08:30] BHW: I think you might have a disease called 'Dengue'. This is a mosquito-borne infectious disease.

[09:00] BHW: Its symptoms are fever, body aches, cough, and diarrhea.

[09:30] BHW: We need to be careful especially here in Quezon because there are many mosquitoes here especially during the rainy season.

[10:00] BHW: It's important to use a mosquito net at night, and wear long clothes so we don't get bitten by mosquitoes.

[10:30] BHW: We also need to make sure that there's no stagnant water around us because that's where mosquitoes multiply.

[11:00] Mr. Pedro: Ah, I see. Thanks for the information, child.

[11:30] BHW: Oh, it's nothing, Mr. Pedro. Just doing my job.

[12:00] BHW: To be sure, I would like to take you to the health center for a check-up and to get tested.

[12:30] BHW: It's also important that you drink plenty of water and eat nutritious food to boost your resistance.

[13:00] BHW: I'm going home now, Mr. Pedro. I'll be back tomorrow to accompany you to the health center, okay?

[13:30] Mr. Pedro: Thank you, child. Sorry for the inconvenience.

[13:45] BHW: It's not an inconvenience, Mr. Pedro. It's part of my job.

[14:00] BHW: I'll be back tomorrow morning to accompany you to the health center, okay?

[14:15] Mr. Pedro: Yes, alright child. Thanks for your help.

[14:30] BHW: Oh, it's nothing, Mr. Pedro. Take care.
