[00:00] BHW: Good afternoon, Mrs. Maria. How are you feeling today?

[00:30] Mrs. Maria: Good afternoon too, Barangay Health Worker. I'm feeling a bit unwell, there are times when I feel dizzy and nauseous.

[01:00] BHW: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. It might be due to your pregnancy. But let's see. We just need a little time to assess your condition.

[02:00] BHW: We can start with your symptoms. Apart from dizziness and vomiting, are there any other symptoms you are experiencing?

[02:30] Mrs. Maria: Sometimes, my back hurts and I get tired easily.

[03:00] BHW: Thank you, Mrs. Maria. How about your eating and sleeping, are they normal?

[03:30] Mrs. Maria: Not really, I can't taste the food, so I can't eat properly. I also have difficulty sleeping.

[04:00] BHW: I understand. How about your previous pregnancies, did you have similar experiences?

[04:30] Mrs. Maria: No, this is different. I feel worse now.

[05:00] BHW: It might be due to your age, Mrs. Maria. But I assure you that we will address this.

[06:00] BHW: Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you exercise regularly, Mrs. Maria?

[06:30] Mrs. Maria: Not much, always tired.

[07:00] BHW: And your family, do they have any history of diseases that could affect your pregnancy?

[07:30] Mrs. Maria: Not that I know of.

[08:00] BHW: That's good. Is this your last pregnancy or do you plan to have more children in the future?

[08:30] Mrs. Maria: This is the last one, Barangay Health Worker.

[09:00] BHW: Thank you for your openness, Mrs. Maria. For now, it's important that we take care of your health for you and your baby.

[10:00] BHW: Second, even though you're tired, let's try to have a little exercise. It could be a simple walk around your house.

[10:30] BHW: And lastly, we need to make sure you are getting enough sleep. This will help your condition and the health of your baby.

[11:00] BHW: With all of this, it's also important that we talk to your doctor. They are knowledgeable about the best action for your condition.
