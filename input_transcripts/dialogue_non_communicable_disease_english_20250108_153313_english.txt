[00:00] BHW: Good morning, Ka Siony. How are you feeling today?

[00:30] Ka Siony: Good morning too, Ka Linda. My chest is a bit painful, but I'm okay.

[01:00] BHW: I am worried about you. It's good that I visited you today. Let's check your condition.

[01:30] Ka Siony: Thank you for your concern, Ka Linda.

[02:00] BHW: Ka Siony, may I know when did your chest pain start?

[02:30] Ka Siony: It's been about a week, I guess.

[03:00] BHW: Do you have any other symptoms? Like dizziness, fatigue, or rapid heartbeat?

[03:30] Ka Siony: Sometimes, I feel like I'm going to faint from dizziness.

[04:00] BHW: Oh dear, Ka Siony. This seems serious. We need to find out the cause. Is there a history of heart disease in your family?

[04:30] Ka Siony: Yes, Ka Linda. My father died from heart disease.

[06:00] BHW: How about your lifestyle, Ka Siony? Do you eat properly and exercise?

[06:30] Ka Siony: It's quite difficult, Ka Linda. Honestly, I rarely eat vegetables. I eat more meat.

[07:00] BHW: Remember, Ka Siony, that a balanced diet is important for our health. Do you also eat a lot of fruits?

[07:30] Ka Siony: Not really, Ka Linda.

[08:00] BHW: And about exercise, do you walk or do any physical activities?

[08:30] Ka Siony: Not much either, Ka Linda. I sit most of the time.

[09:00] BHW: Ka Siony, the symptoms you're feeling may be due to a heart condition. We need to pay attention to this.

[09:30] BHW: It's important that we eat nutritious food, like fruits and vegetables, and avoid too salty and fatty foods.

[10:00] BHW: In addition, we also need to exercise. Even simple daily walking can help improve your condition.

[10:30] Ka Siony: Thank you, Ka Linda. I will try your advice.

[11:00] BHW: That's good, Ka Siony. We need to do this for your health.

[12:00] BHW: Next week, I will come back here to check your condition. We might need a doctor's help if your condition does not change.

[12:30] Ka Siony: Thank you, Ka Linda. I look forward to your visit.

[13:00] BHW: Don't worry, Ka Siony. If needed, we can go to the health center for further check-up.

[13:30] Ka Siony: Okay, Ka Linda. I will follow your advice and I will also see a doctor.

[14:00] BHW: That's good, Ka Siony. Remember that your health is most important.

[14:30] Ka Siony: Thank you, Ka Linda. Take care on your way home.

[14:55] BHW: You too, Ka Siony. Take care and rest. I will come back next week for your follow-up check-up.
