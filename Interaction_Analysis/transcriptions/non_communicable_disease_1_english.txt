[00:00] BHW: Good afternoon, Tay Pedro. How are you feeling today?
[00:05] Patient: Ah, hello to you too, dear. There's still a bit of a twinge in my chest, but it's better compared to yesterday.
[00:12] BHW: Thank you for sharing your condition, Tay Pedro. Every piece of information is important for your health. I plan to have a little chat about your illness and how it might affect your daily life.
[00:26] Patient: Of course, dear. What do you want to know?
[00:29] Patient: It's been about two weeks, I think. When I lift heavy things or sometimes even just walking, there's a twinge in my chest. Sometimes there's difficulty breathing, especially when I've been exposed to the sun's heat for a long time.
[00:42] Patient: I can't remember anything, dear, but my father died of a heart attack before.
[00:48] BHW: This information is important, Tay Pedro. From our conversation, it seems there's a possibility that what you're feeling is related to your heart.
[00:57] Patient: In my heart? I don't know, dear. I don't even drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes.
[01:03] BHW: It's not just alcohol and cigarettes that can affect our heart, Tay Pedro. This also includes our nutrition, exercise, and stress. How is your diet? Do you eat a lot of fat, salt, or processed foods?
[01:18] Patient: Quite often, dear. I usually eat canned goods, instant noodles, and fried foods.
[01:24] BHW: And as for exercise, do you have any regular activity?
[01:28] Patient: None, except for the work in the field.
[01:32] BHW: Your lifestyle and what you eat may be causing what you're feeling, Tay Pedro. It's very important that we monitor what we eat and make sure we exercise. We need to reduce eating processed foods, like canned goods and instant noodles. It's better if we eat fresh vegetables, fruits, and lean meats.
[01:54] Patient: It's just difficult, dear, especially with a limited budget.
[01:58] BHW: I understand, Tay Pedro. But there are also affordable and nutritious foods available. And if possible, set aside time for simple exercises. And above all, we need to consult a doctor to better diagnose your condition.
[02:13] Patient: Okay. I'll keep that advice in mind.
[02:15] BHW: Thank you, Tay Pedro. Next week, I'll come back to find out about your progress. For now, I'll try to ask for help from our local doctor for you. I would like you to have a check-up so we can have a proper diagnosis and the right medicine.
[02:32] Patient: Okay, dear. Where is that and when?
[02:35] BHW: At our Rural Health Center, Tay Pedro. You can go on Tuesday, around two in the afternoon. I'll accompany you if you want.
[02:44] Patient: Alright, dear. Thank you for your help.
[02:47] BHW: Tay Pedro, your health is important. I'll come back next week to find out about your condition. Take care and I hope you can follow through with what we discussed.
