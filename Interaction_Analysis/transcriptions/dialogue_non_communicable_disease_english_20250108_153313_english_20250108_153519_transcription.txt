Good morning, Kashioni. How are you feeling today? Good morning, too, Kalinda. My chest is a bit painful, but I'm okay. I am worried about you. It's good that I visited you today. Let's check your condition. Thank you for your concern, Kalinda. Kashioni, may I know when did your chest pain start? It's been about a week, I guess. Do you have any other symptoms, like dizziness, fatigue, or rapid heartbeat? Sometimes, I feel like I'm going to faint from dizziness. Oh dear, Kashioni, this seems serious. We need to find out the cause. Is there a history of heart disease in your family? Yes, Kalinda. My father died from heart disease. How about your lifestyle, Kashioni? Do you eat properly and exercise? It's quite difficult, Kalinda. Honestly, I rarely eat vegetables. I eat more meat. Remember, Kashioni, that a balanced diet is important for our health. Do you also eat a lot of fruits? Not really, Kalinda. And about exercise, do you walk or do any physical activities? Not much either, Kalinda. I sit most of the time. Kashioni, the symptoms you're feeling may be due to a heart condition. We need to pay attention to this. It's important that we eat nutritious food, like fruits and vegetables, and avoid too salty and fatty foods. In addition, we also need to exercise. Even simple daily walking can help improve your condition. Thank you, Kalinda. I will try your advice. That's good, Kashioni. We need to do this for your health. Next week, I will come back here to check your condition. We might need a doctor's help if your condition does not change. Thank you, Kalinda. I look forward to your visit. Don't worry, Kashioni. If needed, we can go to the health center for further check-up. Okay, Kalinda. I will follow your advice and I will also see a doctor. That's good, Kashioni. Remember that your health is most important. Thank you, Kalinda. Take care on your way home. You too, Kashioni. Take care and rest. I will come back next week for your follow-up check-up.
