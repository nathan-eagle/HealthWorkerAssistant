Good morning, Kanelia. How are you feeling today? Good morning, too, Kalina. Well, I'm not feeling very well. I've been coughing and having a fever. Oh, I'm sorry for only being able to visit now. Let's see what could be causing your illness. All right. Thank you, Kalina. Let's start with the symptoms. Apart from coughing and fever, do you feel anything else? I also have a cold and I often feel tired. How many days have you been feeling this? Did you have any other illnesses in the past few days? About five days now. I didn't have any other illnesses before this. Are there any members of your family who have similar symptoms? None. It's just me. I understand. Thank you for sharing. Let's talk about your lifestyle. What do you usually eat? I usually eat fish, vegetables, and rice, sometimes meat. How about your exercise? Do you have any regular exercise? Not really. I often clean the house and garden. Is there any family history of illness? My mother has high blood pressure, but no other illnesses. Thank you. Based on your symptoms, you might have the flu. It's a type of disease that can be caught from others. What should I do? It's important that you rest and drink lots of water. You also need to eat nutritious food and avoid people so they won't get infected. Also, take medicine for your cough and fever. If these don't go away within a week, we need to consult a doctor. All right. I will follow your advice. That's good. Remember, health is important. Next week, I will come back to check on your recovery. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call me. Thank you, Kalina. I will take care of myself. For now, we need to isolate to prevent infecting others. Eat nutritious food and drink lots of water. Above all, we need to stay positive. Most people with the flu recover quickly. All right. I will do everything you said. That's good, Kanelia. Take care. I will come back next week to check on your recovery. Thank you, Kalina. I will also take care.
