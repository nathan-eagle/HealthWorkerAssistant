# BHW Clinical Protocol Structure
Based on the BHW Reference Manual and related documents, we can definitely develop structured protocols. The manual provides clear competency requirements, program guidelines, and scope of practice that we can codify.
Key advantages of this approach:

Based directly on official DOH materials
Aligns with BHW training and certification standards
Clear boundaries for scope of practice
Built-in escalation pathways
Supports both clinical and health promotion roles

## Initial Protocol Categories
Basic vital signs collection / health assessment
Maternal health 
Communicable diseases & disease surveillance
Non-communicable diseases

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Protocol Usage
- Protocols should guide but not replace BHW judgment
- Clear documentation requirements
- Built-in escalation pathways

2. Data Collection
- Standardized forms aligned with FHSIS
- Integration with existing master lists
- Support for offline data entry

3. Clinical Decision Support
- Simple algorithmic checks
- Red flag identification
- Automated referral recommendations

4. Education Component
- Built-in health education messages
- Community organizing guidance
- Cultural considerations

## Next Steps

1. Technical Implementation
- Convert protocols to JSON/YAML format
- Build validation rules
- Create offline-capable database schema

2. Validation Process
- Review with DOH representatives
- Pilot test with BHWs
- Iterate based on feedback

3. Integration Plan
- Start with basic vital signs
- Add maternal/child health
- Expand to other programs
