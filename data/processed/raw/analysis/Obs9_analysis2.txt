1. Patient Diagnosis
Patient experiencing anxiety or nervousness ("nervyos") with reported palpitations. Blood pressure 100/80 mmHg (normal range). Insufficient information to determine if this is an isolated episode or chronic anxiety condition.

2. Additional Questions
- Duration and frequency of nervousness symptoms
- Specific triggers for anxiety episodes
- Associated physical symptoms beyond palpitations
- History of diagnosed anxiety, panic attacks, or mental health conditions
- Current medications, including those for anxiety/cardiac conditions
- Caffeine, alcohol, or substance use patterns
- Recent significant life stressors
- Previous anxiety management strategies attempted
- Personal/family history of cardiac conditions
- Family history of anxiety disorders
- Sleep patterns and quality

3. Recommendations
- Complete vital signs assessment (pulse, respiratory rate)
- Education on anxiety symptoms and physical manifestations
- Simple relaxation techniques instruction (deep breathing)
- Lifestyle modifications (caffeine reduction, sleep hygiene)
- Healthcare provider referral if symptoms persist/worsen
- Emergency care guidance for severe symptoms
- Symptom and trigger tracking diary
- Healthy stress coping mechanisms discussion
- Follow-up appointment scheduling
- Anxiety management educational resources
- Depression screening (common co-occurrence)

4. Red Flags and Concerns
- Dismissive approach to anxiety ("Think happy thoughts," "Change it")
- No systematic anxiety symptom assessment
- Divided attention during patient interaction
- "Reparel" medication mentioned without explanation
- No exploration of serious palpitation causes
- Absence of follow-up or escalation plan
- Unaddressed patient frustration/emotional distress
- Disorganized conversation lacking essential health information
- No suicidal ideation assessment
- Minimal therapeutic communication techniques

5. Cultural Competency Observations
- Overly casual terms of address in professional context
- Need to consider cultural beliefs about mental health
- Recognition of somatic expression of psychological distress
- Awareness of potential mental health stigma
- Dismissive responses potentially reflecting cultural minimization
- Privacy concerns during sensitive health discussions
- Importance of culturally-appropriate anxiety management approaches
- Need for respect when discussing emotional/mental health concerns
