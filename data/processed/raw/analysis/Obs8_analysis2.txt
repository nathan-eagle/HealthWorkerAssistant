1. Patient Diagnosis
Impossible to determine a clear diagnosis from this highly disjointed conversation. References to medication changes and prescriptions exist, but no clinical condition is identified. The number "160" is mentioned, possibly referring to blood pressure, but cannot be verified.

- Current symptoms, if any
- Existing medical conditions

- Relevant medical history
- Recent health status changes
- Concerns about current medications
- Meaning of "pusita" in this context
