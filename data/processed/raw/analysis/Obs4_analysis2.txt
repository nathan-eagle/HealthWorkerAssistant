4. Red Flags and Concerns
- Infected wound without proper systematic assessment

5. Cultural Competency Observations
- Appropriate use of respectful terms ("nanay") for elderly
- Casual, familiar approach common in Filipino community healthcare
- Need for clearer explanations in simple language
- Consideration of traditional healing practices
- Rushed interaction limiting patient questions
- Potential RHO access barriers not addressed
