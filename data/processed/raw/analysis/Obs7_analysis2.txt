1. Patient Diagnosis
Well-child visit for Samantha Faye Suarez, a 23-month-old infant (mother's report) miscalculated by BHW as 2.5 months old. Temperature 36.4Â°C (normal), weight 6.4 kg. BHW notes baby is "small," suggesting growth concerns. No acute illness reported.

2. Additional Questions
- Accurate age verification (23 months vs. BHW's calculation of 2.5 months)
- Birth history (weight, gestational age, complications)
- Current feeding patterns and nutrition
- Developmental milestones appropriate for age
- Complete immunization history
- Length and head circumference measurements
- Past medical history (illnesses, hospitalizations)
- Sensory development (hearing, vision)
- Family social situation and support
- Genetic/family history of childhood conditions
- Previous growth measurements and trajectory

3. Recommendations
- Urgently clarify correct age for appropriate assessment
- Plot growth parameters on age-appropriate charts
- Review/update immunizations based on correct age
- Provide nutritional counseling for potential growth concerns
- Conduct age-appropriate developmental assessment
- Schedule follow-up based on findings
- Educate parents on developmental milestones
- Address parental concerns about growth/development
- Consider nutritionist referral if growth concerns confirmed
- Document accurate information in health record
- Provide age-appropriate safety guidance

4. Red Flags and Concerns
- Critical age calculation error (23 months vs. 2.5 months)
- Inappropriate assessment parameters due to age miscalculation
- Growth concerns noted without proper chart assessment
- No developmental screening performed
- Immunization status not verified or planned
- Unusual blood pressure measurement for infant
- Disorganized information gathering and record-keeping
- Absence of nutritional assessment despite growth concerns
- Dismissal of mother's correction about child's age
- Lack of systematic well-child assessment approach

5. Cultural Competency Observations
- Appropriate inquiry about religion relevant to health practices
- PhilHealth status verification for healthcare access
- Need for greater respect for mother's knowledge about her child
- Importance of active listening rather than contradicting parents
- Recognition of extended family's role in Filipino childcare
- Awareness of cultural influences on growth expectations
- Need for clearer communication and encouraging questions
