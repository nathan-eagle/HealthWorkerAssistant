[TextBlock(text="Good afternoon, Aling Maria. How are you feeling today?\n\nGood afternoon too, Kabarangay. I'm not feeling very well. There are times when I feel dizzy and nauseated.\n\nOh, I'm sorry to hear that. It might be due to your pregnancy. But we'll check on it. We just need a little time to assess your condition. We can start with what you're feeling. Aside from dizziness and nausea, are there any other symptoms you're experiencing?\n\nSometimes, I also experience back pain and I get tired easily.\n\nThank you, Aling Maria. How about your food intake and sleep? Are they normal?\n\nNot really. I can't taste the food properly, so I can't eat well. I also have difficulty sleeping.\n\nI understand. How about your previous pregnancies? Did you experience similar symptoms before?\n\nNo, this is different. I feel worse now.\n\nIt might be due to your age, Aling Maria. But I assure you that we will help you with this. Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you exercise regularly, Aling Maria?\n\nNot much anymore. I'm always tired.\n\nAnd your family, are there any histories of illnesses that may affect your pregnancy?\n\nNone that I know of.\n\nThat's good. Is this your last pregnancy or are you planning to have more children in the future?\n\nThis is the last one, Kabarangay.\n\nThank you for being part, Aling Maria. For now, it's important that we take care of your health for you and your baby. First, we need to make sure that you're eating enough and balanced. It's also important to take your vitamins and iron supplements. Second, even if you're tired, let's still try to have a little exercise. It can be a simple walk around your house. And lastly, we need to ensure that you're getting proper sleep. This will help your condition and the health of your baby. In all of these, it's also important that we talk to your doctor. They have the knowledge of the best action for your condition.\n\nThank you, Kabarangay. I will follow your advice.\n\nThank you, Aling Maria. After our conversation, I will call your doctor to inform them about your condition. Next week, I will come back to see if there are changes in your symptoms. But if you have any concerns, don't hesitate to call me. For now, we will start the changes in your routines. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.\n\nNothing, Kabarangay. You've been a great help to me.\n\nThat's my job. Aling Maria, what's important is that you and your baby are healthy. I will come back next week. Just make sure that if you feel anything bad, call immediately.\n\nYes, Kabarangay. Thank you very much.\n\nYou're welcome, Aling Maria. Take care of yourself and your baby. Until next time.", type='text')]
