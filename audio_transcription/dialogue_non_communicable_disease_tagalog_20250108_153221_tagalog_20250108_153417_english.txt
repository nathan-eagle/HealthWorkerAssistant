[TextBlock(text="Good morning, Kasyoni. How are you feeling today?\nGood morning, Kalinda. My chest is a bit painful, but I'm okay.\nI'm worried about you. It's good that I was able to visit you today. Let's check on your condition.\nThank you for your concern, Kalinda.\nKasyoni, may I know when your chest pain started?\nI think it's been about a week.\nDo you have any other symptoms? Like dizziness, fatigue, or rapid heartbeat?\nSometimes, I feel like I'm going to faint from dizziness.\nOh no, Kasyoni. This seems serious. We need to find out the cause. Do you have a history of heart disease in your family?\nYes, Kalinda. My father died of heart disease.\nHow about your lifestyle, Kasyoni? Do you eat well and exercise?\nIt's quite difficult, Kalinda. To be honest, I rarely eat vegetables. I eat more meat.\nLet's keep in mind, Kasyoni, that a balanced diet is important for our health. Do you also eat a lot of fruits?\nNot much either, Kalinda.\nAnd in terms of exercise, do you walk or do any physical activity?\nNot much anymore, Kalinda. I mostly sit.\nKasyoni, the symptoms you are experiencing may be due to a condition in your heart. We need to pay attention to this. It's important that we eat nutritious food, like fruits and vegetables, and avoid too much salty and fatty foods. In addition, we also need to exercise. Even simple walking, every day, can help improve your condition.\nThank you, Kalinda. I will try your advice.\nThat's good, Kasyoni, we need to do this for your health. Next week, I will come here again to see how you are doing. We may also need the help of a doctor if your symptoms don't change.\nThank you, Kalinda. I will expect your visit.\nDon't worry, Kasyoni. If needed, we can also go to the Health Center for additional check-up.\nOkay, Kalinda. I will follow your advice and see a doctor.\nThat's good, Kasyoni. Remember that your health is the most important.\nThank you, Kalinda. Take care on your way home.\nYou too, Kasyoni. Take care and rest. Next week I will be back for your follow-up check-up.", type='text')]
