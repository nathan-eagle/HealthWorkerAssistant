[TextBlock(text="Good morning, Kanelia. How are you feeling today?\n\nGood morning too, Kalina. Well, I'm not feeling very well. I have a persistent cough and fever.\n\nOh, I apologize for not visiting sooner. Let's see what could be causing your illness.\n\nThank you. Let's start with the symptoms. Besides cough and fever, do you feel anything else?\n\nI also have a cold and I often feel tired.\n\nHow many days have you been experiencing these symptoms? Did you have any other illnesses in the past few days?\n\nAbout five days now. I didn't have any other illness before this.\n\nIs there any member of your family who has similar symptoms to yours?\n\nNone. It's just me.\n\nI understand. Thank you for telling me. Let's talk about your lifestyle. What do you usually eat?\n\nI usually eat fish, vegetables, and rice. Sometimes meat.\n\nHow about your exercise? Do you have any regular exercise routine?\n\nNot much. I often clean the house and plant in the garden.\n\nIs there any history of illness in your family?\n\nMy mother has high blood pressure, but no other illnesses.\n\nThank you for sharing your symptoms. You may have the flu. It's a type of illness that can be contracted from other people.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nIt's important that you rest and drink plenty of water. You also need to eat nutritious food and avoid people so they don't get infected. Take medicines for your cough and fever as well. If these don't go away within a week, we need to consult a doctor.\n\nI will follow your advice.\n\nThat's good. Let's remember that health is important. Next week, I will come back to see how your recovery is going. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call me.\n\nThank you, Kalina. I will take care of myself.\n\nFor now, we need to isolate to avoid infecting others. Eat nutritious food and drink plenty of water. Above all, we need to stay positive. Most people who get the flu recover quickly.\n\nAlright, I will do everything you said.\n\nThat's good, Kanelia. Take care. I will be back next week to see how your recovery is going.\n\nThank you, Kalina. I will also take care.", type='text')]
